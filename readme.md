# Breast cancer detection using machine learning

## Introduction

This project is about detecting breast cancer using machine learning. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. The features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
